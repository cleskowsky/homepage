Trying out a pretty cool static site generator (or CMS?) by [Statamic](https://statamic.com/). It's like Jekyll - which I've been using for my blog - but with a great dashboard to manage content and much more direct control of theming.

I think I like it! :)

Here's a picture of Carmen I took when we were in Norway earlier this year. Thank goodness we went somewhere before the madness of Covid19 hit ... :'(
